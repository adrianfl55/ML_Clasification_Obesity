# ML_Obesity_Classification

## Description
This is a Machine Learning project focused on classifying different degrees of overweight and obesity in a population. The project utilizes a dataset related to obesity and applies various machine learning algorithms to perform classification.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Obesity dataset containing multiple features related to weight, height, lifestyle, and eating habits.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Cross-validation to assess model performance.
  - Different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
- Julia installed
